## Prompt Quizzer - Lab Assignment 4 (Simple Math Quiz)

Hi! This is my personal portfolio website made for Lab Assignment 4 at K.R. Mangalam University.

Just so you know, this folder holds my work for Lab Assignment 4: Prompt Quizzer - A Quiz Game. This is a simple quiz made only with JavaScript that pops up questions in your web browser.

## What’s Inside

This is a basic quiz application that uses simple JavaScript code. Here is what it does:

The Quiz: It asks you five easy math questions.

Asking and Answering: Questions come up in a small box (prompt()), and a message box (alert()) tells you right away if your answer is correct.

Score: The app keeps track of your score and shows you the final result when you finish the quiz.

Checking Answers: The code checks your answer correctly, even if you use capital letters or add extra spaces by mistake.

## Tech Used

How to Run It

Make sure you have both files, index.html and quiz.js, in the same folder.

Open index.html by double-clicking it. It will open in any web browser.

The quiz will start right away with the first question pop-up. Good luck!
